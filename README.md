For this project, you will be building a Chrome Extension that enables autocomplete for text fields on any website. Imagine you are writing a blog, filling out a form, or writing anything on a website, and you have an AI copilot to suggest completions for all the text you write, similar to what Cursor does with code.

Getting Started:

Check out the Chrome Extension docs [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started) 

Project Requirements:

​Display inline text completions while the user is typing
​Complete the text when the user hits tab
Handle edge cases like scrolling, text selection, and cursor position
​Work across sites without breaking their existing functionality
Challenges:

Ensure minimal latency in the AI responses
Handle focus, selection, and undo/redo functionality
Perfectly match the textarea's font, size, and position
